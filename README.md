# grehawk-weather
This repostory is meant for my code simulating the weather mechanics from Gary Gygax Greyhawk publication 1987
Just run it in your interpreter.
You may need to change some of the global variables such as switching between debug boolean between true or false or farenheit AM/PM conversion.
This is about a week's worth of development in version 1. I realized too late about the festivals so it requires a rewrite. Moon phases aren't perfect but I'm too stupid to figure out how to make a malformed cos line to simulate it properly.

Feel free to share the code or modify it and redistribute for personal use. Just credit me for the work.
